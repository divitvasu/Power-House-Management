# Power-House-Management
> Tools - C language

## About

This project has been built from a demonstration point of view to exhibit the learnings imbibed from a C programming course, during my undergraduate studies at Ganpat University. The program enables the user to see data like power capability of the plant, Efficiencies, Load capacity, Capacity Factor and load distribution from the plant to the sub-stations. Also, it requires login credentials to be provided.

## Shortcomings

This program is quite basic and conceptual leveled and cannot be taken in for industrial applications. This was an introductory project to C. It lacks closeness to real world entities. It does not incorporate the use of databases, which thus would not provide freedom to the user to store and manipulate data as an when needed.
Also it does not provide with much options and functionalities that would be required at the operations level of a power house.
